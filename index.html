			Near the dawn of the web, a language was born,<br>
			Its purpose then for many yet unknown.<br>
			A scripting companion for HTML to adorn,<br>
			To bring life to pages – a skill waiting for you to hone.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			The year was ninety-five and in Netscape,<br>
			Brendan Eich's creation would start coming alive.<br>
			From humble beginnings, 10 days in the make,<br>
			To conquer the web and help let it thrive.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			A language that bridged the web's many divides,<br>
			That boldly goes beyond our browser's gate.<br>
			From frontend wonders to backend prowess it strides,<br>
			Unveiling its potential, showing its fate.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			Now we stand in an era, full of modern delights.<br>
			JavaScript's journey, whether Web or AI,<br>
			With boundless potential, reaching ever new heights,<br>
			It ignites our mind and makes us fly.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			May JavaScript's legacy forever endure –<br>
			Its potential making us yearn to explore.<br>
			And still, with each passing year, its character does mature.<br>
			A poetic ode to JavaScript — a language for us to adore.<br>
